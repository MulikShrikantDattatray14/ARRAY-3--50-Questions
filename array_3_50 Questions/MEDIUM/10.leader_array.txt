//Problem Statement:-

// Given an array, print all the elements which are leaders. A Leader is an element that is greater than all of the elements on its right side in the array.

Example 1:-
Input:
 arr = [4, 7, 1, 0]
Output:
 7 1 0
Explanation:
 Rightmost element is always a leader. 7 and 1 are greater than the elements in their right side.

 =========================================================================================

1.Brute Force Approach :There is no special intuition needed here. Just a common fact that we need to compare elements in order to find the greatest is more than enough.

Approach:
In this brute force approach, we start checking all the elements from the start of the array to the end to see if an element is greater than all the elements on its right (i.e, the leader).
For this, we will use nested loops where the outer loop will check for each element in the array whether it is a leader or not.


function printLeadersBruteForce(arr, n) {

  let ans = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    let leader = true;
    //Checking whether arr[i] is greater than all 
    //the elements in its right side
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
      if (arr[j] > arr[i]) {
        // If any element found is greater than current leader
        // curr element is not the leader.
        leader = false;
        break;
      }
    // Push all the leaders in ans array.
    if (leader)
      ans.push(arr[i]);

  }

  return ans;
}
// Array Initialization.
let n = 6;
let arr = [10, 22, 12, 3, 0, 6];
let ans = printLeadersBruteForce(arr, n);
for (let i = 0; i < ans.length; i++) {
  console.log(ans[i]);
}


================================================================================================================================================================================================================================



Optimal Approach : First, weâ€™ll start the traversal from the right. Then, we move toward the left. Whenever we encounter a new element, we check with the greatest element obtained so far.



function printLeaders(arr, n) {
    let ans = [];
    // Last element of an array is always a leader,
    // push into ans array.
    let max = arr[n - 1];
    ans.push(arr[n - 1]);
    // Start checking from the end whether a number is greater
    // than max no. from right, hence leader.
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] > max) {
            ans.push(arr[i]);
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
// Array Initialization.
let n = 6;
let arr = [10, 22, 12, 3, 0, 6];
let ans = printLeaders(arr, n);
for (let i = ans.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    console.log(ans[i]);
}
